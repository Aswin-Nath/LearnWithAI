invalid type: string "## Core Concepts\n\n### Time Complexity\nTime complexity of DFS algorithms can be analyzed using the following factors:\n- Number of nodes in the graph\n- Depth of the graph\n- Number of recursive calls\n\n### Connected Components\nConnected components are subgraphs where every node is reachable from every other node. DFS can be used to find connected components in a graph.\n
